## Summary

The core goals of Congo is to create a robust easy to use MongoDB query library. Congo is a pure header based library, making it easily portable as well as extremely lightweight. Congo uses exclusively MongoDB threadpools for all queries, making it an ideal choice for parallel and scalable ODM parsing.

## How it works

The core way that Congo works, is by using a chainable interface, to find, insert, update and delete documents. This chainable interface uses standard threads, making it a familiar and easy way to interact with MongoDB with a low learning curve.
